    <h2>🎂 Happy Birthday Ritu ❤️</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left; font-size:15px; line-height:1.6">
      Happy Birthday, my love ❤️<br><br>

      From the very first conversation on 24th July, something about you felt different — calm, warm, and real.
      I never imagined that one random conversation would slowly turn into the most meaningful connection of my life.<br><br>

      I still remember how we held hands for the first time, without planning, without words — just two hearts understanding each other.
      I remember the friendship day gift you sent so early, when we barely knew each other, yet it carried so much thought.
      I remember the day you were sick, yet you travelled all the way just to meet me… and how that day became unforgettable with our first kiss.<br><br>

      These moments aren’t just memories for me — they are proof that what we have is genuine.<br><br>

      With you, I’ve learned what comfort feels like.
      With you, I’ve learned that love doesn’t have to be loud — it can be patient, soft, and deeply reassuring.
      You make me want to be better, calmer, stronger — not just for myself, but for us.<br><br>

      On your birthday, I don’t just wish you happiness for today.
      I wish for a future where we grow together, support each other, fight for each other, and choose each other every single day.<br><br>

      I promise to stand by you — in your good days and your bad ones,
      in your silence and your laughter.
      I promise to respect your dreams, protect your heart,
      and love you with honesty and effort.<br><br>

      You are not just my present, Ritu.<br>
      <b>You are my future.</b><br><br>

      Always yours,<br>
      <b>Ritik ❤️</b>
